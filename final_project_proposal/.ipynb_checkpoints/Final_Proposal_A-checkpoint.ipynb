    "This was the first leak, which details an extremely large amount of information about incorporated business, legal tenders, and political candidates in Myanmar.  We will not use the information concerning the political candidates because it is often in Burmese script.  We will not use information concerning the legal tenders, because they are just cached web pages with inconclusive information.  We will be using information on ~250k incorporated businesses, stored in JSON file format.\n",

By establishing the names of founders, investors, and directors as nodes, along with the names of enterprises these people participate in, we hope to weight the edges accordingly and use the \"island method\" to discover powerful people and groups.  By linking them to outside investors, we will hopefully discover a foothold on which to make further research and apply sanctions.\n"
